//! LU decomposition solver

//! This solver performs an LU decomposition and uses a backsolving algorithm
//! to solve the equations.
//! This solver uses the FullMatrix class and therefore is not the preferred
//! solver. It should only be used for small problems and only when the other
//! solvers are not adequate.
