    // of the fluid flux. Although one can see the fluid flux as a material property, since the code makes explicit
    // use of this constitutive equation (apparent from the fact that the biphasic material needs to define the permeability and its
    // strain derivate) it is not a true material property: i.e. it is not meant to be changed and is an inherent
    // assumption in this implementation. Consequently, the fluid flux would be a good example of a domain property.
