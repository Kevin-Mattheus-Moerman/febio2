//! This class serves as a base class for many of the FECore classes. It defines

//! A model component is basically anything that affects the state of a model.
//! For instance, boundary conditions, loads, contact definitions, etc.
//! This class also generates a unique class ID (not be confused with the super class ID)
//! which is used, for instance, by the analysis steps during serialization.
