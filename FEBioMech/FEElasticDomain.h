//! Abstract interface class for elastic domains.

//! An elastic domain is used by the structural mechanics solver.
//! This interface defines the functions that have to be implemented by an
//! elastic domain. There are basically two categories: residual functions
//! that contribute to the global residual vector. And stiffness matrix 
//! function that calculate contributions to the global stiffness matrix.
